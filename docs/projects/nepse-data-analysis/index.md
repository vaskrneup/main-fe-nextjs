description: Nepal being a developing country doesn't have many facilities that Developed Nations have. One of them is easy access to historical data of the Financial Market. I have faced many issues when trying to get historical stock prices for analysis. So, I have written a few APIs for getting data from various sites, to do repetitive tasks on meroshare and many more. Also, I have created a few libraries to make market predictions using various indicators but they are not always accurate.
